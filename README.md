<p> Massage Therapy is a type of therapeutic medicine done by a trained individual on a client who requires treatment for the soft tissue of the body. The practitioner would knead and rub the soft tissue in the body to improve elasticity to the different types of soft tissue contained in and outside the body. Examples of soft tissue that can be found inside and outside the body include <I> tendons, muscles, ligaments, connective tissue otherwise known as the </I><b>fascia</b><I> and skin.</I>

<p>Any individual seeking a massage must ensure to drink plenty of water, for toxins to be flushed successfully out of the body. They should also inform their practitioner of any allergies or injuries prior to receiving any kind of treatment. Because of the tools used by practitioners for example Oils, lotions, towels, and other massage equipment. Massages can be very intimate for some individuals which is why it is important that comfort should be immediately spoken of between client and practitioner. Massage doesnâ€™t always require clothing to be removed and with loose-fitting clothing, clients can receive some forms of massage without any problems or issues. </p>
